# prompt:

assume you as the professional Ai developer for the specific domain and PLC software developer for industries.with keen knowledge in different and current trends.

I  explain my statements.WE are the team of 4 member with 8 hours of time and 7 days to finished the work. Give as the work and assign the work for the 4 members . we all wanted to connect with some thing like github.this was very imortant to us to get the intership .its between the life/dead.

# hackethon problem:

for the ABB company we wanted to create the AI like chatgpt special for the PLC coding.its wanted to convert the human prompt to PLC coding in structure logic and ladder logic.Example:In this challenge, your task is to develop an AI-based system that converts natural language descriptions of control logic into IEC-compliant code. This is like a ChatGPT for automation engineers-you write what the system should do, and the tool generates the actual logic.

# what i wanted in my project:

1.its wanted to convert the human language into plc code in both ladder and structure. the prompt was given by other people with thier own [style.so](http://style.so/) its wanted to convert even in any style of prompt or mistake they do.its wanted to have the grammer checker, becauce many may do error in prompting . so after the prompt it only wanted to enhance the prompt to generate the accurate code.

2.its wanted some storage space to store the prompt they given .and data that used and correction data.

3.its wanted the validation ,verfication-build in verfication tools and error correction. formal verfication and loop verfication. if error found its wanted to sent back to llm to correct the error.

4.logic simulator and checker

5.export format wanted to be company permisiss.

6.its wanted the optimzied with low delay after the prompting.

7.Logic error finder and correction

8.code sinppet

9.single shot promting

10.all wanted to as the single software like the matlab and container.

11.live reading connection to PLC like modbus so on and your suggestion.

12.i wanted to its contain the  switching between ladder and structure.for ladder logic creation ,is we can use the  MBD,FSM to convert into ladder by python.

13.UI was like to be one block for prompt,one block was like the canva with consist of code, it wanted to have the export button in plc extension. its also wated to show the simualtion ,valitaion like what are its expected.

# find the what are the ways we used the below listed in our projects:

1.LLMPLC

2.agent4plc

3.MBD,FSM

4.SMV

6.matiec,nuxmv

# list the best LLM we can used in bot with thier price comparision in indian . we have the maximum of 16gm ram latop.tell us the model we can use in local machine.give the accurate comparision.

list the accurate step by step process like professional without missing any step like requirement list ,wanted library , dependencies software etc. which should be active in current trend .what are the tools required so on.

# i list the priority for time management.

the MoSCoW method:

 # Must-Have (Core Deliverables):

     Natural Language to Structured Text (ST) conversion.

     A functional User Interface (UI).

     Verification: Integration of MATIEC for syntax checking.

    Code Snippets:

    A library of examples to guide the AI (RAG). may

    Containerization

    The final application must be packaged with Docker.

 # Should-Have (If Time Permits):

     Natural Language to Ladder Logic (LD),

     likely via a textual or graphical representation.

     Advanced Verification:

     Integration of nuXmv for formal model checking on simple cases.

     Logic Simulation:

     A text-based explanation of the generated code's execution flow.

 # Could-Have (Bonus Faeatures):

     Prompt Grammar Checker: A pre-processing step to help the user write better prompts.

     Logic Error Finder: Basic checks for common logical mistakes (e.g., two outputs on one rung).

# Won't-Have (Out of Scope for Hackathon):

Live PLC Connection (Modbus): This is a hardware integration task. We will list this as a "Next Step" in our presentation.

Now i state my method i wanted to use the cloud llm , backend workflow of n8n , script with python , vs code , google colab .also suggest what are the way we can improve its.always come up with the two backup plan.

bfore starting the project .list the to do list for the setup environment like the professional.

ask me the question and your doubt that wanted to improve, finish this project.
